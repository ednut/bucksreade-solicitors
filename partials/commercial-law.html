          We give value to our Clientsâ€™ businesses and transactions by performing very peculiar oversight functions in the course of transactions. Drafting and reviewing contracts is a key function we perform under our commercial law practice.</p>
        <p>
          Additionally, we advise on transactions like hire-purchase, equipment leasing, franchising, joint ventures and partnerships and provide the much needed structure for the success of complex transactions such as business acquisition, assets sale and purchase, public/private partnership, private equity funding, etc.
